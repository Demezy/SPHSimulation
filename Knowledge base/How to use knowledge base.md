# How to use knowledge base

## Why do we need it?

1. It is easy to structure knowledge using that way
2. Only one person needs to research specific topic and summarise it. Others can just read it through and understand everything related to our project


## Its structure

1. [000 Index](000%20Index.md) is an entry point to the whole system main. In this note you can find links for general categories (maps of content)
2. MOC (map of content) is a note that contains only links to other notes and short description of the whole category


## How to add new note

Follow the following rules:
1. One note - one topic
	- If it is a complex topic you may need to break it up into smaller ones
2. Link corresponding topics together for easy navigation
3. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a very good tool for using knowledge base
